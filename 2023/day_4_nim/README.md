# Day 4: Nim

This is the first day where I have something to say. I forgot just how much I loved this language! It's quite well-suited for AoC tasks, and although its whitespace-based syntax goes against my internal convictions, it works *very* well for short scripts like this. Some of the tooling needs a little bit of love—*cough* LSP—but the language really is a joy to use.

This was also the fastest part 1 solution I've had so far, which is surprising considering I haden't touched Nim in nearly a year. It really speaks to the Nim's scripting productivity.
