# Day 10: Haskell

Saying I had used Haskell before was a bit a stretch since I hadn't really made anything useful without, and had only just started to learn it. This was certainly some good practice.

Part 2 easily could have become rather obnoxious to solve without using Pick's theorem and the Shoelace formula (which I would not have known about if it weren't for a previous obsession with the Gauss circle problem). Without these, my approach would likely have been casting a ray at each point in the image to determine the winding number. This would have become pretty annoying as you have to account for whether to increase the winding number when the ray travels *along* a series of pipes. Thankfully, this wasn't necessary.
