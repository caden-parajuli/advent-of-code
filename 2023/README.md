# Advent of Code 2023: Easy Mode

These are my Advent of Code 2023 (first-time) solutions, using a different programming language for each day. Although I wrote these solutions significantly after December 2023, it is my first attempt at Advent of Code, and I have tried to solve each problem within a day of first seeing it (this was not possible for the first problem, as I had seen it solved on YouTube before). This is mostly intended as a warmup for the 2024 Advent of Code, for which I have a much harder challenge planned.

## Rules

1. Only the listed language may be used, with the exception of configuration languages used by the language tooling.
2. External libraries, written in either the listed language or any other, may not be used, unless they are strictly necessary for reading an input file.
