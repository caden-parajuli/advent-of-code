# Day 9: Java

This was probably the easiest day so far, and certainly the easiest part 2 so for, since part 2 required changing only 2 lines from part 1 (aside from the Java class name). Although I tend to dislike Java's OO nature, I will say it is pretty easy to be productive and get things done with it for tasks such as this. I'm excited to get to Go, since I've heard this is one area where it excels.
