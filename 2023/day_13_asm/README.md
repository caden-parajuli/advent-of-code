# Day 13: Intel x86_64 Assembly (FASM)

I've been dreading this day ever since I planned out which languages I would use. How fitting that it fell on day 13 (I just now noticed this). All in all, the experience wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, even though it was my first time writing a full program in assembly. I was even able to completely avoid using the stack, which was nice.

## Rules

- NO LIBRARIES, not even C standard library. Only Linux system calls are allowed.
- Not allowed to look at the output of a compiler for the duration of the challenge.
- Allowed to write a program in a different language to help think through the problem (I didn't end up doing this)

## Running

This program must run on an x86_64 Linux system, and must be assembled using [fasm](https://flatassembler.net).
