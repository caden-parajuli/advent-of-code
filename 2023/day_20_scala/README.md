# Day 20: Scala

## Lanugage

Wow, this is definitely the most fun I've ever had using the JVM. I can still feel a little of the Java/Kotlin influence, but I mostly mean that in a good way. Scala does a very good job of not trying to shove a programming paradigm (either OO *or* FP) down your throat, while making both feel pretty easy to use at the same time. I must say, I'm impressed. The only other language I've seen do this so well is OCaml. Although the language server feels like it could have more features (i.e. I'm too used to rust-analyzer), it's still a dream come true after Kotlin. I will *definitely* reach for Scala in the future when I need something to run on the JVM.

## Problem

I don't like problems like this. I'm pretty sure the general case can't be solved as it requires solving the Halting Problem. This one is definitely worse than day 8, which can be solved in full generality with the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

## Running

Just run `sbt run` in the root directory (this one).
