# Day 11: Fish

Although this is not the tool I would want to use for a task like this, it wasn't that bad. It makes me realize that fish had a good enough design that it works pretty well for simple things, but once they get slightly complex it starts to push you to use something else, which I think is a good thing. Not everything should be written in a shell scripting language.
