# Day 19: Kotlin

## Running

To run, first place your `input` file in the *root directory (this one)*, and run `gradle run`.

## Language

Kotlin was certainly more enjoyable to work with than Java purely as a language, although I'm still not a *huge* fan of it. It does get the job done. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the Kotlin Language Server to work with Neovim, which made everything pretty painful, especially considering the great intellisense I was used to with Java.
