# Day 14: Gleam

This is the first of the languages I've never used before, and it's a great one! Although Gleam seems to be very poorly suited for this kind of problem, the language itself was incredibly easy to pick up. Aside from a few gotchas (like lack of file input it the standard library and no direct ByteArray indexing), it almost felt like I already knew this language. I'm definitely going to consider using it in the future for anything distributed or with high concurrency.
