# Day 7: Guile Scheme

I'll admit, saying I'm "comfortable using" Guile might have been a bit of a stretch. I assumed since I used it to configure Guix and did a bit of light programming with it and Emacs Lisp that it would be pretty easy to fill in the gaps. While it wasn't too hard, the experience wasn't very enjoyable due to the complete lack of any support for Guile Scheme in Neovim apart from a tree-sitter parser. It's been a while since I programmed without some sort of language server or at least linter, and for Lisp dialects I was used to Emacs' first-class support.

I think given enough time I could develop some good macros and patterns for working with Scheme in Neovim, but it's unlikely I'll have any reason to since I switched from Guix System to NixOS.
