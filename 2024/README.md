# Advent of Code 2024: Hard Mode

## Rules

- The program may receive the input in any form, even from another tool or program, as long as the input it receives does not provide any additional information about the data beyond what is necessary to pass input to the main program (e.g. length of input).
- If the tool/program is able to read the input file directly, it MUST do so and cannot use another method.

## Language Plan

### Week 1: I mean I guess you can program with that...
- Day 1: Coq

### Week 2: So you think you know GNU and Linux?
- Day 8:  POSIX shell
- Day 9:  GNU Octave
- Day 10: AWK
- Day 11: gmake
- Day 12: sed
- Day 13: sendmail
- Day 14: jq

### Week 3: Wait is that even Turing complete?
- Day 16: Minecraft (Vanilla)
- Day 17: Vim normal mode (NO SCRIPTING)
- Day 18: Rust macro/type system only
- Day 19: SQL
- Day 20: Godot Visual Scripting

### Week 4: Please just stop.
- Day 22: CPP (C preprocessor)
